PRD v2.5: Sveltronkit + Human-in-the-Loop Cagent (RPG Format) - INTEGRATED

CORE PROBLEM & VISION

Problem: Content creators waste 10+ hours/week manually extracting photos from Apple Photos, editing them in multiple tools, writing captions, and scheduling posts across platforms.

Solution: A local-first desktop AI command center (Sveltronkit-based) that brings the AI to the user's data, with human-in-the-loop decision points for agent architecture, integrating the proven Sveltronkit foundation from v2.0.

Success Metrics:
- 80% of media workflow automated via AI agents
- < 5% manual intervention rate after initial setup
- Zero user photos uploaded to external servers (privacy-first)

HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

Key Decisions To Be Made Together:
1. Cagent Team Structure: Single orchestrator with handoffs vs independent specialized agents
2. Default Models: Optimal LLM selection for each agent role (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
3. RAG Strategy: Shared brand knowledge vs agent-specific knowledge bases
4. A2UI Protocol: Safety constraints for agent-generated UI components
5. Timeline Integration: How Twick timeline component integrates with A2UI widgets
6. Sveltronkit Configuration: Template selection and initial setup from v2.0 proven architecture

Architecture Overview (Integrated from v2.0):
- Tier 1: SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 Runes + shadcn-svelte UI with Twick timeline and A2UI-generated widgets
- Tier 2: Electron 32+ Main managing Python sidecar lifecycle with context isolation
- Tier 3: Cagent engine with configurable LLM providers and native RAG (NO external ChromaDB)
- External: Cloudinary MCP servers for media operations and Postiz for publishing

TASK MASTER INTEGRATION

This PRD is structured for optimal parsing by Task Master's parse-prd tool:
- Capabilities → Main tasks with clear dependencies
- Features → Subtasks with acceptance criteria
- Dependency Chain → Topological task ordering
- Phases → Development roadmap with human checkpoints
- Integration Points → Explicit references to v2.0 proven architecture

The dependency-aware task graph ensures proper sequencing while maintaining flexibility for human decisions during implementation, particularly around the Sveltronkit foundation and Twick timeline integration from the proven v2.0 architecture.
